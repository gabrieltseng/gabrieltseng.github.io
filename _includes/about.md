I am a PhD student at [McGill](https://www.mcgill.ca/) / [Mila](https://mila.quebec/), working under the supervision of Professor [David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/) to investigate ways in which machine learning can help fight climate change. This includes working with Professor [Hannah Kerner](https://hannah-rae.github.io/) at [NASA Harvest](https://nasaharvest.org/).

My research focusses on applications of machine learning to agriculture. We can [learn a lot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16866) about global agricultural practices from satellite data, and we generate an enormous amount of satellite data. I investigate how machine learning algorithms can be applied to this satellite imagery. In particular, I think about how we can take advantage of the metadata which accompanies satellite imagery and agricultural data to [improve machine learning in this regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02124).

In addition to machine learning for agriculture, I am interested in / have been lucky to contribute to:
* **Technology for good**, such as to [better understand natural hazards](https://github.com/esowc/ml_drought), or to [increase energy access](https://okrasolar.com/)
* **Interpretable machine learning** using [open source tools](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)
* **Rock climbing**<sup>[1](#note)</sup> (and visiting [beautiful places](https://i2.wp.com/oolongaloha.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4514.png?w=2280&ssl=1) to climb there)

In addition to the technical blog [here](/blog), I also have a non technical blog, at [oolongaloha.com](http://oolongaloha.com)
