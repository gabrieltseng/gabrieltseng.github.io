I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Okra Solar](https://okrasolar.com/), exploring the applications of machine learning to smart solar microgrids. I also work with [NASA Harvest](https://nasaharvest.com/), using remote sensing to estimate which crops are being grown where.

I am interested in / have been lucky to contribute to:
* **Technology for good**, such as to [better understand natural hazards](https://github.com/esowc/ml_drought), or to
[increase energy accessibility](https://okrasolar.com/)
* **Interpretable machine learning** using [open source tools](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)
* **Rock climbing**<sup>[1](#note)</sup> (and visiting [beautiful places](https://i2.wp.com/oolongaloha.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4514.png?w=2280&ssl=1) to climb there)

In addition to the technical blog [here](/blog), I also have a non technical blog, at [oolongaloha.com](http://oolongaloha.com)
