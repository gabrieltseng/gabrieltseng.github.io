Hello! My name is Gabi. I am a Research Scientist at Ai2 on the [Earth System Team](https://allenai.org/earth-system). I'm also finishing a PhD at McGill / Mila under the supervision of Professor [David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/), investigating ways in which machine learning can help mitigate and adapt to climate change. This includes working with Professor [Hannah Kerner](https://hannah-rae.github.io/) at [NASA Harvest](https://nasaharvest.org/).

Land use is one of the [most important environmental issues](https://www.monbiot.com/2022/08/19/unholy-cow/), and agriculture is the [main driver](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use) of land use. My research seeks to better understand the Earth's landcover using remote sensing data, with a focus on improving the machine learning algorithms used to make large scale agricultural landcover maps.

In addition to machine learning for remote sensing and agriculture, I have been lucky to contribute to:
* **Technology for good**, such as for [sustainable and regenerative farming](https://www.agri-tech-e.co.uk/small-robot-co-brings-its-per-plant-farming-service-to-50-farms/), or to [increase energy access](https://okrasolar.com/)
* **Interpretable machine learning** using [open source tools](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)

I also love spending time outdoors, either by [climbing](https://i2.wp.com/oolongaloha.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1600244370139-1-scaled.jpg?strip=info&w=2000&ssl=1) or [running](https://i0.wp.com/oolongaloha.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DJI_0070-1-scaled.jpg?w=2280&ssl=1) in [beautiful](https://i2.wp.com/oolongaloha.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_20211120_122140.jpg?strip=info&w=1254&ssl=1) [places](https://i2.wp.com/oolongaloha.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4514.png?w=2280&ssl=1).

In addition to the technical blog [here](/blog), I also have a non technical blog, at [oolongaloha.com](http://oolongaloha.com)
