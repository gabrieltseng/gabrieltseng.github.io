I'm at ICML in Vancouver presenting [Galileo](https://icml.cc/virtual/2025/poster/44450). We'll also be presenting 2 papers at the [Terrabytes Workshop](https://terrabytes-workshop.github.io/): our [LFMC estimates using Galileo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20132v1) and [WorldCereal's integration of Presto](https://esa-worldcereal.org/en/resources/webinars).
