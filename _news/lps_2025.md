I'm at the Living Planet Symposium in Vienna, where I'm talking about [Presto](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14065) and [Galileo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09356). In the [same session](https://lps25.esa.int/programme/programme-session/?id=3B6EF15D-E53F-4BAA-8C8C-F6F7C253C8F0), Christina Butsko will also talk about Presto's deployment within the WorldCereal system. If you are also at LPS, come say hi!
