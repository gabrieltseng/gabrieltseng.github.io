Galileo is accepted to ICML! We develop a new self-supervised learning algorithm tailored to remote sensing, and use it to train a model which achieves state-of-the-art results across a diversity of remote sensing tasks (ranging from image segmentation to pixel-timeseries classification). Check out the [code](https://github.com/nasaharvest/galileo) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09356).
